% MultiHybrid -- Apply Shrinkage to Wavelet Coefficients
%  Usage 
%    ws = MultiHybrid(wc,L)
%  Inputs 
%    wc    Wavelet Transform of noisy sequence with N(0,1) noise
%    L     low-frequency cutoff for Wavelet Transform
%  Outputs 
%    ws    result of applying HybridThresh to each dyadic block
%

ws = wc;
[n,J] = dyadlength(ws);

for j=J-1:-1:L;
    %[min(dyad(j)) max(dyad(j))]
    ws(dyad(j))=HybridThresh(ws(dyad(j)));
end;
